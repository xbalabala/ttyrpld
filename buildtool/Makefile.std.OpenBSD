# 1. ttyrpld is preferably compiled with gcc3 or better.
#
# 2. OpenBSD 3.6 had gcc2, the updated gcc3 from ports was called "egcc" then.
#
# 3. libintl.so does not have any reference to libiconv.so (like it should be),
#    so we have to specify it too:

#CC         := egcc
#LD         := egcc
CFLAGS     += -I/usr/local/include
LDFLAGS    += -L/usr/local/lib
EXT_LDLIBS += -liconv -lintl
