TTYRPLD


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~

ttyrpld is a kit to log any traffic and actions
which go through any of your Kernel's tty
devices. In common-term language, this is a
Keylogger (and Screenlogger).

The complete documentation (including manuals) is
written in HTML. Please see doc/index.html for
further information. If you are one of these text
console lovers (/me is one, too!), consider using
w3m (a text web browser, obviously).

The package is written in UTF-8 so do not be
surprised if some chars, such as "micro", the
copyright/left sign but especially localization
translations seem screwed. In that case, you need
to flip some settings.
