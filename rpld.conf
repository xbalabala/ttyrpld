# OFMT combines the directory to write the tty recordings into (relative to the
# working directory of rpld) and the name of the log files.
#
#   %d    Time when tty was opened (usually when someone logs in or an
#         xterm was opened). In YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS format.
#   %l    Terminal (line) the user logged on
#   %u    User who owned the tty when it was opened. If the device could not
#         be stat()'ed, %u will substitute to "NONE". If the UID could not
#         be translated into a name, the UID is spit out instead.
#
# If you do not like the @, change it into something more appalling.
#
# Note that the order you specify for the different tags affects the order the
# files will show up in `ls`. Make this your advantage.

OFMT=/var/log/rpl/%u/%d.%t.%l

# Pretty self-explanatory. The reason it is here is to allow commericial
# providers to ONLY track the usage (i.e. byte counts) rather than actually
# keeping the data. If you only want counting, use DO_LOG=no.

# User to change to after all initialization. Make sure that the user can

# The INFOD component allows a "remote" local process (i.e. a process not
# related to rpld, but running on the local machine) to change certain logging
# options. See rplctl(8).
